### Key Components

- **NostrReleaseProvider**: Manages Nostr connections and release data
- **ReleaseExplorer**: Main browsing interface with filtering
- **ReleaseCard/ReleaseList**: Release display components
- **DownloadPage**: Detailed release information and download
- **FilterBar**: Release filtering controls
- **PublisherModal**: Publisher switching interface

### Data Flow

1. App initializes NDK connection to Nostr relays
2. Subscribes to NIP-94 events from current publisher
3. Processes and filters releases based on user criteria
4. Displays releases in selected view mode
5. Provides detailed download pages with verification info

## NIP-94 Event Structure

The app expects NIP-94 file metadata events with these tags:

```json
{
  "kind": 1063,
  "tags": [
    ["url", "download_url"],
    ["m", "mime_type"],
    ["x", "file_hash"],
    ["architecture", "target_architecture"],
    ["device_id", "device_identifier"],
    ["supported_devices", "device1,device2"],
    ["openwrt_version", "openwrt_version"],
    ["tollgate_os_version", "version"] // or tollgate_core_version
    ["release_channel", "stable|beta|alpha|dev"]
  ],
  "content": "Release description"
}
```

## Customization

### Styling

The app uses a theme system defined in `src/styles/theme.js`. Key customization points:

- Colors: Primary, background, text colors
- Typography: Font sizes, weights
- Spacing: Consistent spacing scale
- Breakpoints: Responsive design breakpoints

### Default Configuration

- **Default Publisher**: TollGate official pubkey
- **Default Relays**: Damus, Nostr Band, nos.lol, Snort
- **Default Filters**: Stable channel only, all products
- **View Mode**: Grid view (cards)

### Mock Data

When no releases are found from the official TollGate pubkey, the app displays mock releases for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm test`: Run tests
- `npm run eject`: Eject from Create React App

1. **New Filters**: Add filter logic to `utils/releaseUtils.js`
2. **UI Components**: Follow styled-components patterns in `components/common/`
3. **Nostr Integration**: Extend `contexts/NostrReleaseContext.js`
